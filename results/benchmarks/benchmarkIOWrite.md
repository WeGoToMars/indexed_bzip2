## Observations

 1. All 5 write methods (p)write(v) and fwrite reach similar maximum bandwidths.
    Writing into an emptied file           : 3.2-3.4 GB/s (the vectorized variants tend to be slightly faster)
    Writing into a sparsely allocated file : 3.4 GB/s
    Writing into a preallocated file       : 4.7 GB/s
    Pwrite is slightly (10%) faster but that might be because of the differing (multithreaded) benchmark setup
    or because it only executes a single pwrite call per thread, i.e., the chunk size is as large as the file size
    divided by the thread count.
 2. pwritev and writev require at least a chunk size of 4 KiB but from there are relatively stable.
    Note that the total data, considering the chunk count, in ALL cases is much larger than the chunk size
    used for pwrite and write.
 3. fwrite needs at least write sizes >= 64 KiB, while write needs >= 16 KiB to reach the maximum speed.
 4. Using more threads for pwrite does NOT speed things up!
    And while the mean stays somewhat stable, the minimum tends lower for more threads, probably because of stragglers.
 5. ftruncate + mmap DOES profit from more threads, reaching somewhat of a maximum at 8 threads,
    but it is still SLOWER than a simple single-core pwrite.
 6. Writing to 4 files from 4 threads doubles the write speed to ~8.7 GB/s!
    However, how can I make use of this when I want one result file?!
 7. Writing to separate mmaps, even when they all are part of the same file descriptor, just different chunks of it,
    increases the write speed significantly to those comparable when writing to a preallocated file: ~4.5 GB/s!

## Observations

 1. Similarly to /dev/shm, all 5 write methods (p)write(v) and fwrite reach similar maximum bandwidths.
    Writing into an emptied file           : 2.5 GB/s
    Writing into a sparsely allocated file : 4.4 GB/s
    Writing into a preallocated file       : 4.4 GB/s

## Observations

 1. Similarly to /dev/shm, all 5 write methods (p)write(v) and fwrite reach similar maximum bandwidths.
    Writing into an emptied file           : 2.0 GB/s
    Writing into a sparsely allocated file : 2.6 GB/s
    Writing into a preallocated file       : 2.8 GB/s
 2. Similarly to /dev/shm, pwritev and writev require at least a chunk size of 4 KiB but from there are relatively
    stable. Note that the total data, considering the chunk count, in ALL cases is much larger than the chunk size
    used for pwrite and write.
 3. In contrast to /dev/shm, write and fwrite require at least write sizes >= 1 MiB KiB (instead of 64 KiB)
    to reach the maximum speed.
 4. Similarly to /dev/shm, using more threads for pwrite does NOT speed things up!
    And while the mean stays somewhat stable, the minimum tends lower for more threads, probably because of stragglers.
 5. Similarly to /dev/shm, ftruncate + mmap DOES profit from more threads, reaching somewhat of a maximum at 8 threads,
    but it is still SLOWER than a simple single-core ftruncate + write. Note that mmap already is preceded by ftruncate.
 6. Similarly to /dev/shm, Writing to 8 files from 8 threads more than doubles the write speed to ~7.7 GB/s!
 7. Similarly to /dev/shm, fwrite and write are equally fast except for 1 KiB chunks, for which write is SLOWER
    than fwrite maybe because fwrite is buffered?
 8. O_DIRECT slows preallocated pwrite done a lot on my SSD.
 9. Similarly to /dev/shm, fwrite and write are equally fast except for 1 KiB chunks, for which write is SLOWER
    than fwrite maybe because fwrite is buffered?
10. Allocation is 100x faster than /dev/shm !? But only sometimes. Maybe ext4 has a buffer of reusable sectors?

## Observations

 1. No speedup over directly using /dev/shm, even a little bit slower especially for the preallocated case.

## Observations

 1. No speedup over directly using /dev/shm, even a little bit slower especially for the preallocated case.

# Test on HomePC with FUSE ramdisk

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegreyd/FuseFilesystem.git
cd FuseFilesystem
make
mkdir /media/fuse-ramdisk
./ramdisk /media/fuse-ramdisk $(( 5*1024 ))
```

Had to do the benchmark with an 8 MiB file because it is so excruciatingly slow!

posix_fallocate seems to indicate an O(size^2) complexity for file creation!
